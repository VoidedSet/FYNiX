<h1>FYNiX: Framework for Yet to be Named eXperiences!</h1>
I have decided to give my self 10 days to build a simple game engine in Cpp. This project is more of a learning project.
<br> 
You can follow this repo on your own risk!
<br>
Using OpenGL, GLFW and Glad.
<br>
<br>

<h2>Aim</h2>
- Load models with materials (done)
<br>- Load animations
<br>- Have a scene management system (done)
<br>- Simple GUI (possibly with gizmos) (done)
<br>- Save Levels and settings and load them (done)
<br>- Physics
<br>- Lighting (basic lighting done)

<br>
Additionally I will try to make a game using this engine as a showcase!
